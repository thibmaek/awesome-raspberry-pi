# Contribution Guidelines
> The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title will be closed right away. Please make sure you checked every box in the PR template.

## Adding an item to the list
1. Make sure you are editing README.md only, no other files are allowed to be edited.
2. Add your item to the category it belongs to. Try to avoid creating completely new categories.
3. Make sure your item is added to the bottom of the items listed in a category, don't add it in at the middle.
4. Don't submit dead links and try to always submit HTTPS links.
5. Make sure you're linking to an English resource, other languages not allowed *at this moment*
6. If there is only support for some devices please mention that by using the [badges](/media/badges) provided.
7. Add something that is truly awesome and stands out. A project that shows how to monitor a greenhouse, water a plant or trigger LEDs are already out there on the web. This is not the place for those.
